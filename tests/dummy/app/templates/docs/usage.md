# Usage

## Requirements

To use EBF Design System, your addon must have a `devDependency` of Ember v2.8 or higher.

## Install

To install the Ember CLI Addon you can use the following command:

```shell
ember install @ebf/ember-cli-design-system
```

If you wish to use only the SASS or CSS files without Ember components use this NPM library instead:

```shell
npm install @ebf/design-system
```
