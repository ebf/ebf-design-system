# Layout

Components and options for laying out your UI, including wrapping containers, a powerful grid system, a flexible media object, and responsive utility classes.

## Grid

EBF Design System uses Bootstraps grid system which is composed out of series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth look at how the grid comes together.

## Media

The media object helps build complex and repetitive components where some media is positioned alongside content that doesn’t wrap around said media. Plus, it does this with only two required classes thanks to flexbox.
