# Language switcher

Component that renders the Language switcher as a Bootstrap Dropdown component.

It uses the locale service under the hood to extract the list of available locales, the currently active locale and to update it.

 The component has a single boolean argument `showFlags` to display flags before language label. Omitting this argument will hide the flags.
